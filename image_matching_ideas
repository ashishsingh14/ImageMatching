get the output after pooling layer, and get the similarity from the matrix

The code in the blog post is aimed at Python 2, where writing to and reading from a file works with bytestrings. In Python 3, you need to open the file in binary mode, both for writing and then reading again

a = [1,2,3,3]
b = [i for i in a if i!=2]
b = [0 if i==2 else 99 for i in a]


what is thread safe?
